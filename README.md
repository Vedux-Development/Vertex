# Vertex

Vertex is an advanced Discord bot that can help you manage your Discord server<br>
To get help join the [Discord sevrer](https://discord.gg/EcdPApY8Kd)

# Future of Vertex

Due to Discords choices with their api I (Ducksquaddd) will stop working on Vertex. Discord is trying to force developers to switch to slash commands by making the message intent privileged.<br>
I get that I can switch to slash commands. However the bot still reads messages for things such as the spam filter. I work on Vertex in my free time and for free I dont want to/feel like rewriting vertex<br>for the soon to come api changes. I have published all the code that I have been working on for the version one update that was supposed to be released. If you do decide to use it.
